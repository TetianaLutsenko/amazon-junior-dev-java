# Course Management System (Java)

## Overview
This project is a simple Java application created to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
The system allows a learner to enroll in different types of courses (online or classroom) and calculates a final grade based on course-specific rules.

The main focus of the project is understanding the difference between **abstract classes** and **concrete classes**.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I learned how to:

- Create and use **abstract classes** (`Course`)
- Implement **concrete classes** (`OnlineCourse`, `ClassroomCourse`)
- Use **inheritance** to share common behavior
- Apply **polymorphism** to avoid conditional logic
- Use **interfaces** to define common actions
- Design cleaner and more maintainable Java code

---

## Summary
This project demonstrates how abstract classes define shared structure while concrete classes provide specific implementations.  
It helped reinforce core OOP principles and improved my understanding of Java class design.
