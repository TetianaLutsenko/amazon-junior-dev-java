# Java Interfaces Lab

This project is part of my learning journey in the **Amazon Junior Software Developer â€“ Programming with Java** course.
It demonstrates how **interfaces** in Java solve the problem of multiple inheritance and how they can be combined with abstract classes.

## Overview

In this lab, I implemented **interfaces** in Java.

- Java does not support *multiple inheritance* directly.

- Instead, it allows a class to **extend one superclass and implement multiple interfaces.**

- This provides flexibility while keeping the design clean and maintainable.

## What I Did

- Created a **Person** abstract superclass with common attributes.

- Built **Student** and **Employee** subclasses that:

    - Inherit functionality from the **Person** abstract class.

    - Implement their respective interfaces (**StudentInterface**, **EmployeeInterface**).

- Practiced combining **abstract classes** and **interfaces** in the same design.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this lab, I learned how to:

- Define and implement **Java interfaces**.

- Use interfaces to model **real-world contracts**.

- Combine **abstract classes** and **interfaces** in a class hierarchy.

- Apply **abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism** in a single project.
