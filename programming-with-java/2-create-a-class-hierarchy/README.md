# Java School System â€“ Class Hierarchy Example

This project demonstrates a simple school system implemented in Java with the following class hierarchy:

- **Person** (abstract base class)
- **Student** (extends Person)
- **Employee** (abstract subclass of Person)
- **Teacher** (extends Employee)
- **MyDate** (helper class for date handling)

The project illustrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including **abstract classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Design a clean and maintainable OOP class hierarchy
- Use encapsulation effectively with private fields and getters/setters
- Implement both abstract and concrete classes
- Apply polymorphism with methods like `getDetails()`
- Handle date formatting consistently using the `MyDate` class
- Manage salary in `Employee` and `Teacher` classes

## Summary

This project reinforced best practices for **safe field access** and **structured object-oriented design** in Java.  
It serves as a foundational example of applying OOP principles to a real-world school system model.
