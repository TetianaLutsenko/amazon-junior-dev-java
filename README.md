Hello everyone!  

My name is Tanya, and welcome to my repository.  
I’m passionate about learning, and I’m currently advancing my skills in software development through the **Amazon Junior Software Developer** course.  

I created this repository to **store my course projects**, track my **learning progress**, and **share my work** with others who are interested in software development.  

I hope this repository can serve as a helpful reference for anyone exploring Java, OOP concepts, and practical programming exercises.  

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore or provide feedback!
